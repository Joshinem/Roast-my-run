Terms of Use

Roast My Run — Terms of Use
Effective date: 29 December 2025

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Roast My Run mobile application (the “App”). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not use the App.

1. Who we are

The App is operated by Roast My Run (“we”, “us”, “our”).
Contact: hello@joshcooling.co.uk

2. What the App does

Roast My Run lets you:

upload a screenshot of a running results screen,

confirm/edit extracted run statistics,

generate humorous “roasts” and a general training tip (“coach tip”),

save and share results.

The App is intended for entertainment and general fitness motivation.

3. Entertainment only, not professional advice

The App provides lighthearted commentary and general training suggestions. It is not medical advice and is not a substitute for professional coaching, healthcare, or safety guidance.

You are responsible for your own training decisions. If you have health concerns, seek professional advice before exercising.

4. Acceptable use

You agree not to:

use the App unlawfully,

attempt to reverse engineer, scrape, or abuse the service,

use the App to generate content that is hateful, harassing, discriminatory, sexually explicit, or that encourages self-harm,

upload content you do not have the right to use.

We may suspend or restrict access if we believe you are misusing the App.

5. Content and safety

We aim for “roast the run, not the runner.” The App is designed to avoid content about protected traits, appearance/body, hate/slurs, or self-harm.

However, AI systems can be imperfect. If you see content you believe is inappropriate, please contact hello@joshcooling.co.uk
.

6. User content and sharing

You may upload screenshots and generate text outputs. You are responsible for what you choose to share publicly.

When you share content from the App to third-party platforms (social media, messaging apps), their terms and privacy policies apply.

7. Subscriptions, billing, and trials

The App requires a paid subscription and may offer a free trial. Current intended pricing:

Weekly: £3.99/week (3-day trial)

Monthly: £9.99/month (3-day trial)

Billing is handled by Apple via your App Store account. Your subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel in your Apple ID subscription settings.

We do not control Apple’s billing systems and cannot issue refunds outside of Apple’s processes.

8. Service availability and changes

We may update, modify, suspend, or discontinue parts of the App at any time. We do not guarantee uninterrupted service.

9. Intellectual property

The App, its design, branding, and software are owned by us or our licensors. You receive a personal, non-transferable license to use the App for personal purposes.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App.

10. Disclaimer of warranties

The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not make warranties that the App will be error-free or that AI output will always meet expectations.

11. Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for:

any indirect, incidental, or consequential loss,

training-related injuries or decisions you make,

issues arising from third-party services (Apple, Cloudflare, OpenAI, social platforms).

Nothing in these Terms limits liability where it cannot legally be limited.

12. Termination

You can stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these Terms.

13. Governing law

These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales, and courts in England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction, unless local consumer laws require otherwise.

14. Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms occasionally. If changes are material, we will provide notice in-app or via an updated effective date.
